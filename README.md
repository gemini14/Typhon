Typhon
======

This is a cross-platform LAN-based multiplayer racing game aimed at families and friends.  Projected platforms are currently Windows and Linux.  It uses the open-source, cross-platform Irrlicht engine.  It uses the CMake build system.

Typhon is simply the code name, since I haven't chosen an official name for it yet.
